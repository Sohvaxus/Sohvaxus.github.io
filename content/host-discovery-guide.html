								<p>This guide aims to be a complete collection of tools used for internal or external host discovery. Depending on the scenario these tools can be used in different ways. When stealth is important, you might want to go for a passive discovery approach. When you can make as much noise as you want, a more active approach can be helpful. Host discovery on internal networks is also mostly different from host discovery on external networks.In this guide you will learn how to use these tools in every scenario, how stealthy each tool is and even in to as much detail as which types of packets they send out.</p>

								<h5>Description</h5>
								<p>The goal of this chapter is to discover internet facing hosts while you're outside of the network. It involves testing publicly available IP addresses or domains that are accessible via the internet. This part of the guide assumes that you've already obtained an IP or range of IPs against which you want to run scanning tools. If you're not sure how to obtain a range of public IP addresses, the first part of my <a href="mitre-attack-active-scanning.html">active scanning guide</a> will explain this perfectly.</p>
								<h5 id="icmp_protocol">1.1 ICMP Protocol (ping and fping)</h5>
								<p>The most efficient way to discovery if a target is online and reachable is utilizing the ICMP protocol. The most well known tool you can use for this is <strong>ping</strong>. Ping will send an ICMP echo request to the target and wait for an ICMP echo reply, thus actively interacting with and touching the target. This can result in pings being filtered by a firewall at the target. Additionally, if you want to conduct a ping sweep on a range of IP addresses you could use <a href="https://fping.org/">fping</a>. Note that fping is not available on Windows. There are Windows versions available on Google, but downloading these binaries is not recommended. If you must, do so with caution.</p>
								<code>
# Example ping - This will send a single echo request to the target
ping -c 1 192.168.0.1
									
# Example fping - This will iterate over the 192.168.0.0-255 range and send an echo request to every IP in the range
fping -g 192.168.0.0/24
								</code>
								<hr class="solid">
								<h5 id="ping_os_detection">1.2 OS Detection with Ping</h5>
								<p>Fun fact: The operating system of your target can be determined by analyzing the TTL of your ICMP packets in the ping output. When looking at the most widely used operating systems on the internet we can see the following:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Unix / Linux TTL: 64</li>
									<li>Windows TTL: 128</li>
									<li>Solaris / AIX TTL: 265</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Note that there could be defenses in place that alter TTL values, which makes OS fingerprinting not accurate via TTL values. It doesn't happen often, but it's possible.</p>

								<hr class="solid">
								<h5 id="nmap_host_discovery">1.3 Nmap</h5>
								<p>Another great tool for internal or external host discovery is Nmap. Nmap is an incredibly versatile tool and can be leveraged to bypass ICMP echo filtering and get more accurate results. We can use the <strong>-sn</strong> option to do host discovery on an IP range. This option will do no port scanning after the host discovery and print out all reachable hosts it found in the IP range. It will also do a reverse DNS lookup on the IPs and return any domains names it found.</p>

								<h6>Stealthiness</h6>
								<p>Running Nmap with the <strong>-sn</strong> option will also touch the target, and even more so than ping or fping. This option will send an ICMP echo request, a TCP SYN packet to port 443, a TCP ACK packet to port 80, and an ICMP timestamp request by default. Unprivileged Unix users (or Windows users without Npcap installed) can't send these raw packets. In that case only SYN packets are sent. Even though this scan will also touch the target, it is considered a light scan and will not attract much attention. If you would like to get more details, please refer to this <a href="https://nmap.org/book/host-discovery-controls.html">Nmap Host Discovery Controls guide</a>.</p>
								<h6 id="stealthy_nmap_host_discovery">1.3.1 Stealthy Nmap Host Discovery</h6>
								<p>There is a way to leverage Nmap to do host discovery without touching the target at all. When running Nmap with the <strong>-sL</strong> option, no packets will be sent to the target, but it will simply list all hosts on the IP range provided. What it will also do by default is a reverse DNS lookup which will return the names of the scanned hosts if available. This scan can still be very useful to start off with if stealth is important, since this will not set off any detection alarms like an IDS. As stated by Nmap documentation it is possible, but highly unlikely, that the target will notice all of the reverse DNS requests. If this is a concern you can use the <strong>--dns-servers</strong> option to bounce through anonymous recursive DNS servers. For more information regarding this option, please refer to this <a href="https://nmap.org/book/host-discovery-controls.html">Nmap Host Discovery Controls guide</a> and this <a href="https://nmap.org/book/subvert-ids.html#defeating-firewalls-dns-proxy">Nmap DNS Proxying guide</a>.</p>

								<h5 id="masscan_host_discovery">1.3 Masscan</h5>
								<p>If you're looking to scan very large networks very fast, then <a href="https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/masscan">Masscan</a> is the tool to use. This tool will send 1.6 million packets/second on a non-virtualized Linux machine. That's enough to crash your entire home network. On Windows or VM's it's a bit slower with around 300 000 packets/second. The default rate is 100 packets/second, and it can be controlled with the <strong>--rate</strong> option. Although it can overwhelm your local network, it will not do that to distant networks since it randomly switches between target IP addresses while scanning.</p>
								<p>Masscan will scan ports, which is useful for when ICMP echos are filtered. This will make sure even though ICMP is filtered, we can still discover remote hosts. Note that it will actively send out SYN packets asychronously, so it will touch hosts for discovery. This makes it prone for IDS detection.</p>

					        	</li> 
								<h5>Description</h5>
								<p>Once you're inside the network you'll want to discover all the hosts you can reach. If you were to obtain credentials or authentication tokens it's always good to have a list of internal hosts to try these against and hopefully gain access to another host. There are a couple of ways to go about this, and that includes passive and active host discovery.</p>
								<h6 id="passive_host_discovery">2.1 Passive Host Discovery</h6>
								<p>Passive host discovery is the most stealthy approach. Instead of actively probing for hosts on the network, these tools will sniff for communications between hosts on the network. Note that running these tools in passive mode will put your network card in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promiscuous_mode">promiscuous mode</a>, which will require root level privileges.</p>
								<h6 id="passive_host_discovery_netdiscover">2.1.1 Netdiscover</h6>
								<p>One such tool is <a href="https://github.com/netdiscover-scanner/netdiscover">Netdiscover</a>. Netdiscover can passively sniff for hosts on the network, and will not send out any packets by doing so. It's also possible to sniff a range of IP addresses. It can also be used on hub/switched networks.</p>
								<code>
# Example of passive host discovery
sudo netdiscover -i eth0 192.168.0.1 -p
									
# Example of passive host discovery of an IP range
sudo netdiscover -i eth0 -r 192.168.0.0/24 -p
								</code> <br />
								<h6 id="passive_host_discovery_p0f">2.1.2 p0f</h6>
								<p>The tool <a href="https://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/p0f3/">p0f</a> can also be used to passively discover hosts, although it doesn't do this by default. The <strong>-p</strong> option will have to be passed in the command to sniff in promiscuous mode. Promiscuous mode will not send any packets over the network for discovery, which means it will not touch any hosts. It will however only sniff packets addressed to or routed through the host it's running on.</p>
								<code>
# Example of passive host discovery on the current subnet
└──╼ $sudo p0f -i enp0s3 -p
								</code> <br />
								<h6 id="passive_host_discovery_bettercap">2.1.3 Bettercap</h6>
								<p>Another great tool is <a href="https://www.bettercap.org/">Bettercap</a>. In passive mode this tool will periodically read the system ARP table to discover new hosts on the network. Bettercap will not send out any packets on the network when discovering this way.</p>

								<h6 id="active_host_discovery">2.2 Active Host Discovery</h6>
								<p>Doing active host discovery is similar to doing external host discovery, but you've got more flexibilty. This way of host discovery on the other hand is not as stealthy as passive discovery. Active discovery will send packets on the network to make hosts on the network reply, making this method prone to IDS discovery. The following tools can be used for active host discovery.</p>
								<h6 id="active_host_discovery_netdiscover">2.2.1 Netdiscover</h6>
								<p><a href="https://github.com/netdiscover-scanner/netdiscover">Netdiscover</a> can also actively discover hosts, when doing so Netdiscover will send out ARP requests on the network and wait for hosts to reply with an ARP reply. It's also possible to scan a range of IP addresses this way. It can also be used on hub/switched networks.</p>
								<code>
# Example of active host discovery
sudo netdiscover -i eth0 192.168.0.1
									
# Example of active host discovery of an IP range
sudo netdiscover -i eth0 192.168.0.0/24
								</code> <br />
								<h6 id="active_host_discovery_nmap">2.2.2 Nmap</h6>
								<p>The same <a href="https://nmap.org/">Nmap</a> scan as used with external host discovery can be used. As said before, this scan will also touch hosts on the network. When this scan is run by a privileged user on a local ethernet network, ARP requests are sent instead, just like Netdiscover. Unless the <strong>--send-ip</strong> option is specified.</p>
								<code>
# Example of a Disable Port Scan (-sn) against a local IP range
									
──╼ $nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24

								<h6 id="active_host_discovery_bettercap">2.2.3 Bettercap</h6>
								<p>As well as passive host discovery, it's also possible to do active host discovery with <a href="https://www.bettercap.org/">Bettercap</a> by probing the current subnet. When using <strong>net.probe</strong> Bettercap will send out mDNS, NBNS, UPnP and WSD packets to every IP in the current subnet so the net.recon module can detect them. All packets will be sent out by default, but it is possible to enable/disable the individual packets it sends out. Throttling the packets is also possible. Needless to say, this method will send packets over the network and will touch hosts, making this method intrusive and prone to IDS detection.</p>
								<code>
# Example of active host discovery with Bettercap
# Start Bettercap
sudo bettercap
									
# In the interactive shell, type "net.probe on" to start host discovery
192.168.1.0/24 > 192.168.1.12  » net.probe on
									
# To show what it has found

								<h6 id="active_host_discovery_arpscan">2.2.4 arp-scan</h6>
								<p><a href="https://github.com/royhills/arp-scan">arp-scan</a> is another tool that can be used for active host discovery. It can be used to discover IPv4 hosts on the local Ethernet or wireless network, including hosts that block IP traffic. When it discovers hosts it will also identify vendor details from the MAC address, unless the <strong>--quiet</strong> option is specified. The tool itself has a ton of flexibility and options, way too much to mention here, but we will cover a few interesting things it can do. Please refer to the <a href="https://github.com/royhills/arp-scan/wiki/arp-scan-User-Guide">arp-scan User Guide</a> to discover all of its capabilities.</p>
								<p>Note that using this tool is very visible on the local network. It will broadcast an ARP request for every IP in the local subnet, and capture the reply if a host responds. As a result this tool not stealthy and prone to IDS detection.</p>

								<h6>2.2.4.2 802.1Q VLAN Hopping</h6>
								<p>If the system running arp-scan is on a switch trunk port, then host discovery is also possible in different VLANs. This can be done with the <strong>--vlan</strong> option.</p>
								<code>
# Example of scanning VLAN 2 by using VLAN Hopping
└──╼ $sudo arp-scan --vlan 2
